## Detailed API Setup Guides

### GitHub Stats API Integration

The portfolio uses
[anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
to display repository cards:

1. No setup is required for basic usage - the API is public
2. For higher rate limits:
   - Fork the GitHub Stats repository
   - Deploy it to Vercel
   - Update the `base_url` in `repos.json` to your deployed instance

### Spotify API Setup

To enable the "Now Playing" feature:

1. **Create a Spotify Developer Application**

   - Go to
     [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Click "Create an App"
   - Fill in the app details (name, description)
   - Set the Redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/callback`
2. **Get Required Credentials**

   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret from the app dashboard
   - Generate a refresh token using the following steps:
3. **Generate a Refresh Token**

   ```bash
   # Step 1: Get authorization code (replace CLIENT_ID)
   # Open this URL in your browser:
   https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback&scope=user-read-currently-playing%20user-read-recently-played

   # Step 2: After authorization, you'll be redirected to a URL with a code parameter
   # Extract that code and use it in the following request:

   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "Authorization: Basic <BASE64_ENCODED_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET>" -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=YOUR_CODE&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/callback" https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
   ```
4. **Add to Environment Variables**

   - Add the client ID, client secret, and refresh token to your `.env.local`
     file

### FormSpree Integration

For the contact form functionality:

1. Create an account at [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/)
2. Create a new form and note the form ID
3. Add the form ID to your `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ID`
4. The contact form will now submit messages to your email via FormSpree

### Google reCAPTCHA Setup

To protect your contact form from spam:

1. Go to [Google reCAPTCHA Admin](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
2. Register a new site with reCAPTCHA v2
3. Add your domain(s) to the allowed domains list
4. Copy the Site Key and add it to `.env.local` as
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`

## Customizing the Portfolio

### Personal Information

Edit the main `page.tsx` file in the app directory to update your personal
information:

- Name and professional title
- Bio and personal description
- Contact information (email, phone, location)
- Social media links and professional profiles
- Quote or personal motto

### Professional Interests and Skills

Update the `HomePage.tsx` component to reflect your:

- Professional interests
- Educational background
- Skills and expertise
- Certifications and achievements

### Projects

The projects are loaded from `public/repos.json`. Update this file to display
your own repositories:

```json
[
   {
      "base_url": "https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=yourusername&repo=",
      "repos": {
         "Web Development": [
            "web-project-1",
            "web-project-2"
         ],
         "Machine Learning": [
            "ml-project-1",
            "data-analysis-tool"
         ],
         "Mobile Apps": [
            "mobile-app-1",
            "flutter-project"
         ]
      }
   }
]
```

You can:

- Create custom categories that represent your focus areas
- Add as many repositories as needed in each category
- Change the GitHub username in the `base_url` to your own

### Page Content

Each page's content is defined in its own component in the `components/pages`
directory:

- `HomePage.tsx`: Update your introduction, headline, and key highlights
- `AboutPage.tsx`: Edit your bio, education, and personal story
- `ProjectsPage.tsx`: Customize the project display settings
- `ResumePage.tsx`: Update your professional experience and education
- `ContactPage.tsx`: Modify the contact form fields and submission handling

### Visual Customization

To change the visual appearance:

1. **Theme Colors**: Edit the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
2. **Typography**: Change font settings in `globals.css` and
   `tailwind.config.js`
3. **Profile Picture**: Replace `public/profile_picture_manav_garg.jpeg` with
   your own image
4. **Resume PDF**: Replace `public/resume.pdf` with your current resume

## Advanced Customization

### Adding New Pages

To add a new section to your portfolio:

1. Create a new component in `components/pages` (e.g., `ProjectsPage.tsx`)
2. Add your content and styling
3. Import and include the new component in `page.tsx`
4. Add a navigation link in the main navigation component

### Custom API Routes

For adding new API integrations:

1. Create a new directory in `app/api/` for your API
2. Add a `route.ts` file with your API handler logic
3. Use the API in your components using fetch or axios

## Troubleshooting

### Spotify Integration Issues

- **"Now Playing" not working**: Check your Spotify credentials and make sure
  you're actively playing music
- **API errors**: Verify your refresh token is valid and not expired
- **Rate limiting**: If you see rate limit errors, implement caching or reduce
  request frequency

### GitHub Cards Not Displaying

- Verify your GitHub username is correct in `repos.json`
- Check if repository names are accurate
- Consider deploying your own instance of the GitHub Stats API for higher rate
  limits

### Contact Form Issues

- Check your FormSpree ID is correct
- Verify your reCAPTCHA setup with the correct domain
- Test the form in both development and production environments

## Deployment

This portfolio can be deployed to various platforms:

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login
